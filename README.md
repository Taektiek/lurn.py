This project is made to learn vocabulary in a simple and transparent way.
Currently the project can technically be used to learn wordsets, however it is not recommended. Not because it is buggy, but because it isn't easy to use. Currently you have to change variables in the code to use it to your liking, in the future I will add a configuration file.
